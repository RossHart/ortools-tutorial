    "These problems are designed to show some typical MILP problems. The problem focuses on a typical business problem called decentralisation, and is taken from the textbook [Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H.P. Williams](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Model+Building+in+Mathematical+Programming%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781118443330). Chapter 12 of that textbook has many more interesing MILP problems if people want to do any further reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem has been broken into two parts. The first is a relatively simple MILP about the location of various facilities. The second adds an additional layer of complexity to the problem, and highlights one of the key transforms we can do when introducing integers into the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "When completing these exercises, remember some of the key steps to solving a mathematical program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe the **constraints** and **objectives** verbally.\n",
    "2. Describe the **entities** as sets.\n",
    "3. Describe any **parameters** as sets.\n",
    "4. Define the **decision variables** that seem sufficient to solve the problem.\n",
    "5. Write the **objective function** using the parameters and decision variables.\n",
    "6. Write the **constraints** using sets and decision variables.\n",
    "7. Iterate & repeat until happy."
